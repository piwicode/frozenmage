We consider it more as a draft we used to try our hands at GameMaker and get some experience. Part of the challenge was to craft all the assets: graphics, sounds and code (apart from GameMaker engine).\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nThere is a window binary and an HTML5 version is on its way. If your platform is not available, consider building it from sources.\r\n\r\n### Last word\r\nWhenever you enjoy the game or not, we are always glad to hear about what you thought about it.\r\nAdd a comment if you are in the mood, or mail us at plab_and_niddle@googlegroups.com\r\n\r\nFrom Paris with love.\r\n\r\nPlab & Niddle\r\n",
